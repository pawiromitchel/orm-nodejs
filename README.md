## Generating a new Model

I'm using Sequelize-auto to generate a model based on my table (https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize-auto)

``` sequelize-auto -o "./server/models" -d <database> -h localhost -u root -p 3306 -x <password> -e mysql -t <tables> ```

If you want to generate all your tables, just remove the '-t' with its parameters and let it run.
